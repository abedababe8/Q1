# Online Eatery

A single-page Website that can populate and display an interactive menu and implement the first steps to collect a customer order as usable data

## Why?

I wanted to create something that I had experienced a need for in my work, and something that could take data from a menu and turn it into something sleek, interactive and traversable

## How?

### Using JavaScript, Jquery, CSS and HTML in concert:

* Data-Driven
* Programmatic
* Colorful and Aesthetically Pleasing
