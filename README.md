# Online Eatery

A single-page Website that can populate and display an interactive menu and implement the first steps to collect a customer order as usable data

Can filter by several selectors such as Spicy, Vegetarian, Gluten-free, or by type of dish such as an Entree or side.

### Using JavaScript, Jquery, CSS and HTML in concert:

* Data-Driven
* Programmatic
* Colorful and Aesthetically Pleasing
